The Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan, designed by Nike VP of Advanced Concepts, Tinker Hatfield, and former animator Michael Berger, translates the materials and textures of Mr. Link’s plaid suit, created by LAIKA costume designer Deborah Cook, to a Nike Air Max 1.

Cook explains that Mr. Link’s aesthetic plays up the character’s Pacific Northwest roots and balances it with a desire to serve as playful foil to the urbane Frost. This is also evident in the shoe’s leather-wrapped midsole, cuff links and kurim fur tufts on the tongue that lend a gleefully haphazard elegance to the silhouette.

AO2582-001,Nike Adapt BB Black,Nike,2/17/19,350,Black/White-Pure Platinum,"The Nike Adapt BB is designed to give you a customized, consistent fit as it adapts to your foot to provide a locked-in feel for distraction-free play. The Nike Adapt BB can be paired up with the Nike Adapt app to fine-tune the fit and customize the features from your smartphone.

“We picked basketball as the first sport for Nike Adapt intentionally because of the demands that athletes put on their shoes,” says Eric Avar, Nike VP Creative Director of Innovation. “During a normal basketball game the athlete’s foot changes and the ability to quickly change your fit by loosening your shoe to increase blood flow and then tighten again for performance is a key element that we believe will improve the athlete’s experience.”

How The Shoe Works
When a player steps into the Nike Adapt BB, a custom motor and gear train senses the tension needed by the foot and adjusts accordingly to keep the foot snug. The tensile strength of the underfoot lacing is able to pull 32 pounds of force (roughly equal to that of a standard parachute cord) to secure the foot throughout a range of movement.

That’s where the brain, or FitAdapt tech, kicks in. By manual touch or by using the Nike Adapt app on a smartphone, players can input different fit settings depending on different moments of a game. For example, during a timeout, a player can loosen the shoe before tightening it up as they re-enter the game. In a forthcoming feature, they can even prescribe a different tightness setting for warm-ups. Plus, players can opt in to firmware updates for the FitAdapt technology as they become available, sharpening the precision of fit for players and providing new digital services over time.

How It Was Tested
Similar to the HyperAdapt 1.0, the Nike Adapt BB was put through a gauntlet of tests, including impact tests, intense temperatures, end-of-life tests that lasted tens of thousands of cycles long, waterproof tests to simulate the sweatiest feet and more.

Where It’s Headed
Nike Adapt BB is the first continually updated performance product from Nike due to the near-symbiotic relationship between the shoe’s digital app and the shoe’s opt-in firmware updates. As the FitAdapt system hones the quality of fit in basketball, the next step will be to bring FitAdapt to other sports and lifestyle products, each with unique demands for fit in different environments.",2133,nike adapt bb black,Feb,Sunday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,black white pure platinum,White,442

This particular prank occurred during Stephen’s junior year, while he was out with his teammates on his 21st birthday.

“We went to a little Japanese steakhouse to celebrate, and decisions were made to jump in the koi fish pond at the restaurant. I was the decoy distracting the hostess while Steve [Rossiter] jumped in and tried to grab one of the fish.”
– Stephen Curry
As Rossiter worked to nab a koi fish from the restaurant pond, Curry distracted the hostess. Unfortunately for them, a security camera caught all the action. A videotape from the restaurant made its way to Davidson College men’s basketball head coach Bob McKillop a week later.
The Curry 6 Coy Fish colorway, homophone intended, tells the origin story of a prankster as he returns to his home in Charlotte for the 2019 All-Star Game. This striking colorway is a nod to the vibrant beauty of the koi fish, featuring a bright yellow fully knit upper, a full-length HOVR midsole and a water-like clear outsole for best-in-class traction.",135,under armour curry 6 hi vis yellow,Feb,Friday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,hi vis yellow hi vis yellow guardian green,Yellow,134

During the last few weeks, glimpses of the design — which incorporates a double-height Zoom Air heel unit — came through a preview of Lorenzo’s latest Fear of God offering and then appeared on the feet of NBA stars. The rollout is tactical, all part of Lorenzo’s desire to focus on the emotional element of sport.

“It is a shoe that should only be judged by the emotion it gives the kid when he first sees it — however it makes him feel. We live in a day and age when images are leaked left and right, and products are leaked without consideration and emotional attachments. I’m aiming to give a visceral experience whether the kid sees it first on Ben Simmons coming into the arena or worn by his favorite athletes on court.”

Lorenzo wants to tap into a certain element of nostalgia. Not so much about what was worn, but how it was worn. He wants to awaken a spirit he deems dormant, to remind of the power sport once had in defining style.

“In my youth…growing up in the ’80s and finishing high school in the ’90s, contrary to what’s happening now, it was our superstar athletes and our pro athletes that were informing the way that we wore our street clothes,” he says. “These athletes, like Agassi and Jordan, were at the top of their game and what they wore didn’t compromise on design or beauty.”",1717,nike air fear of god 1 light bone,Jan,Saturday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,light bone light bone,Red,863

There’s a grid-like, protective texture on the tongue and collar, a debossed pattern on the quarter (with hidden “Why Not” logos), a woven finish on the midfoot strap, breathable mesh on the forefoot, and injected TPU for the heel counter. The outsole has concentric circle patterns for multi-directional traction and references Westbrook’s number, 0. It also has a diagram of a “perfect strike” in bowling, a nod to one of Westbrook’s favorite off-court activities, as well as the size tag that’s typically inside the shoe.

At the heel of the left shoe, an external tag highlights the “Future History” color palette seen throughout the vibrant shoe. This external tag will also be on future colorways of Westbrook’s WN0.2, which focus on important people in Westbrook’s life, including his family and fans.

Each shoe has a black patch on the medial midsole for Westbrook’s written tribute to his late friend, KB3. The heel tabs of each shoe also have Westbrook’s signature, while the left heel has the Westbrook logo, the right heel has the Jumpman logo, and both shoes have his family crest on the interior of each tongue.

During the last few weeks, glimpses of the design — which incorporates a double-height Zoom Air heel unit — came through a preview of Lorenzo’s latest Fear of God offering and then appeared on the feet of NBA stars. The rollout is tactical, all part of Lorenzo’s desire to focus on the emotional element of sport.

“It is a shoe that should only be judged by the emotion it gives the kid when he first sees it — however it makes him feel. We live in a day and age when images are leaked left and right, and products are leaked without consideration and emotional attachments. I’m aiming to give a visceral experience whether the kid sees it first on Ben Simmons coming into the arena or worn by his favorite athletes on court.”

Lorenzo wants to tap into a certain element of nostalgia. Not so much about what was worn, but how it was worn. He wants to awaken a spirit he deems dormant, to remind of the power sport once had in defining style.

“In my youth…growing up in the ’80s and finishing high school in the ’90s, contrary to what’s happening now, it was our superstar athletes and our pro athletes that were informing the way that we wore our street clothes,” he says. “These athletes, like Agassi and Jordan, were at the top of their game and what they wore didn’t compromise on design or beauty.”",1057,nike air fear of god 1 black,Dec,Saturday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,black black,Black,795

BV1300-106,Union x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG NRG Varsity Red,Air Jordan,11/24/18,190,White/Varsity Red-Wolf Grey-Black,"Jordan Brand and sneaker shop Union have come together to create and release a unique capsule collection inspired by the late ’80s early ’90s. The collection will include two colorways of the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG along with T-shirts, sweatshirts and pants.

When Jordan Brand’s designers heard Union owner Chris Gibbs’s idea for a vintage-styled Air Jordan footwear and apparel capsule, they were sold. They just had one question — what year?

“We’re referencing an era, late ’80s early ’90s,” explains Gibbs, an industry veteran who grew up during that era and understands that streetwear is at its best when it captures a vibe and is unencumbered by the strict technicalities of history.

Gibbs frequents Los Angeles-area flea markets and vintage stores and is thus familiar with the Jordan touch points of his youth and how those have aged over time. “The Jordan stuff I wear now is like if I go to a vintage market and I find some really old stuff that’s kind of patinaed or weathered in,” he says. “To me, the vintage nature of it allows you to kind of wear it outside of its intended purpose.”

Taking Union’s reputation for elevated taste and commitment to quality fabrics and construction, the Union x Air Jordan collection carefully captures that transcendence. It pulls from a golden era in sports and streetwear — a tone evoked by the color of the wash on the apparel to the careful distressing on the Air Jordan 1s.

The shoes also capture Gibbs’s approach with a fresh perspective on the mashup. Each fuses together classic Air Jordan 1 colorways with a noticeable stitch mark, evidence of a process that celebrates DYI culture and vintage hunting. Gibbs describes the inspiration as finding your most coveted pair of sneakers at the flea market, then elevating it by combining it with another pair to create a unique 1-of-1.

This colorway takes on a color makeup of White/Varsity Red-Wolf Grey-Black which brings together the Black Toes and the White/Grey Jordan 1s. The shoe features a leather build on the upper with suede detailing on the collar and UN/LA branding on the ankle.",1968,union x air jordan 1 retro high og nrg varsity red,Nov,Saturday,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,white varsity red wolf grey black,Black,761

BV1300-146,Union x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG NRG Storm Blue,Air Jordan,11/17/18,190,White/Storm Blue-Varsity Red,"Jordan Brand and sneaker shop Union have come together to create and release a unique capsule collection inspired by the late ’80s early ’90s. The collection will include two colorways of the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG along with T-shirts, sweatshirts and pants.

When Jordan Brand’s designers heard Union owner Chris Gibbs’s idea for a vintage-styled Air Jordan footwear and apparel capsule, they were sold. They just had one question — what year?

“We’re referencing an era, late ’80s early ’90s,” explains Gibbs, an industry veteran who grew up during that era and understands that streetwear is at its best when it captures a vibe and is unencumbered by the strict technicalities of history.

Gibbs frequents Los Angeles-area flea markets and vintage stores and is thus familiar with the Jordan touch points of his youth and how those have aged over time. “The Jordan stuff I wear now is like if I go to a vintage market and I find some really old stuff that’s kind of patinaed or weathered in,” he says. “To me, the vintage nature of it allows you to kind of wear it outside of its intended purpose.”

Taking Union’s reputation for elevated taste and commitment to quality fabrics and construction, the Union x Air Jordan collection carefully captures that transcendence. It pulls from a golden era in sports and streetwear — a tone evoked by the color of the wash on the apparel to the careful distressing on the Air Jordan 1s.

The shoes also capture Gibbs’s approach with a fresh perspective on the mashup. Each fuses together classic Air Jordan 1 colorways with a noticeable stitch mark, evidence of a process that celebrates DYI culture and vintage hunting. Gibbs describes the inspiration as finding your most coveted pair of sneakers at the flea market, then elevating it by combining it with another pair to create a unique 1-of-1.

This colorway takes on a color combination of White/Storm Blue-Varsity Red and draws inspiration from the Bred and Storm Blue colorways. The shoe comes with a leather build on the upper with exposed stitch detailing and suede on the collar. UN/LA branding is also present on the ankle tag.",1691,union x air jordan 1 retro high og nrg storm blue,Nov,Saturday,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,white storm blue varsity red,Blue,875

AO2588-002,Nike LeBron 16 Fresh Bred,Nike,9/20/18,185,Black/University Red,"The Nike LeBron 16 was designed by LeBron James and Jason Petrie. “The knit team at Nike are geniuses,” says Petrie.  “I don’t use that term lightly. They are mathematical artists and have created a new knit for the 16 that is strong enough to contain LeBron and successfully reduces any layers in the overall build that could slow him down.”

The LeBron 16 introduces Battleknit 2.0, an evolved version of the scalloped knit featured on the Lebron 15. Its structure increases tensile strength (important to contain James’s lateral force on court) and it has an elegant finish matching James’s current style.

The LeBron 16’s other notable feature is its height. At the direction of James, Petrie formed the shoe with a lower collar, which allows the athlete to move more freely.

“The first thing we wanted to do was get a little lower in the cut of the shoe,” says James. “I wanted to get a little faster, ride a little bit closer to the court and be a little bit more dynamic.”

Petrie and team also added a new gusseted leather tongue, allowing for seamless entry into the shoe and for broader styling choices off court.

Underfoot, a simple evolution of the Max Air cushioning platform introduced in the LeBron 15 supports James’s dynamic desires. “LeBron liked the cushioning so much last year that we just focused on refining it,” says Petrie. “For this addition, we removed the tendril that connected the forefoot to the under-toe bag, and instead included an outrigger to create some additional support to complement the lower height.”",1747,nike lebron 16 fresh bred,Sep,Thursday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,black university red,Black,172

AQ2465002,Nike LeBron 16 GS Fresh Bred,Nike,9/13/18,160,Black/Black-university Red,"The Nike LeBron 16 was designed by LeBron James and Jason Petrie. “The knit team at Nike are geniuses,” says Petrie.  “I don’t use that term lightly. They are mathematical artists and have created a new knit for the 16 that is strong enough to contain LeBron and successfully reduces any layers in the overall build that could slow him down.”

The LeBron 16 introduces Battleknit 2.0, an evolved version of the scalloped knit featured on the Lebron 15. Its structure increases tensile strength (important to contain James’s lateral force on court) and it has an elegant finish matching James’s current style.

The LeBron 16’s other notable feature is its height. At the direction of James, Petrie formed the shoe with a lower collar, which allows the athlete to move more freely.

“The first thing we wanted to do was get a little lower in the cut of the shoe,” says James. “I wanted to get a little faster, ride a little bit closer to the court and be a little bit more dynamic.”

Petrie and team also added a new gusseted leather tongue, allowing for seamless entry into the shoe and for broader styling choices off court.

Underfoot, a simple evolution of the Max Air cushioning platform introduced in the LeBron 15 supports James’s dynamic desires. “LeBron liked the cushioning so much last year that we just focused on refining it,” says Petrie. “For this addition, we removed the tendril that connected the forefoot to the under-toe bag, and instead included an outrigger to create some additional support to complement the lower height.”",101,nike lebron 16 gs fresh bred,Sep,Thursday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,black black university red,Black,109

AQ1059,adidas POD S3.1 Core Black,Adidas,6/16/18,130,Core Black/Core Black-White,"adidas Originals introduces P.O.D.System, a new silhouette built for purpose. Inspired by collective memory and enhanced through blending technologies, this innovative style translates a technical runner into a new sneaker for the street.

The foundation of the P.O.D.System takes its cue from a unique three-dimensional cushioning design principal first seen in mid-90’s running technology, ‘Point of Deflection System’. A system designed to benefit the runner, the technology provided shock absorption and stability in the outsole at the point of impact. The purposeful design created distinct segments of the sole of the sneaker which provided targeted cushioning for the wearer tailored to each area’s specific requirements. The result was a sneaker that provided comfort to perform.

Inspired by the podular design philosophy, adidas Originals reimagined this concept to create a sneaker built for a new purpose: natural motion. Fusing a high rebound EVA forefoot, BOOST heel and Point of Deflection bridge, the P.O.D. System combines three individual innovations from the past to create the future standard in footwear. Built with the intent to enhance natural motion, adidas BOOST technology is focused on the heel unit, redirecting emphasis to the most important area of the foot for optimal stride. A pronounced inspired by the ‘90s torsion bar is applied across the midfoot providing stability and flexibility to the podular sole allowing for ease of motion.

The debut colorway features a blacked out breathable mesh construction all throughout the upper with contrast underlays, reinforced by welded 3-stripes marks, fabric lace eyelet panels, and a branded heel tab. Additional details include flourescent yellow on the signature ‘Point of Deflection’ bridge, flashes of blue on the tongue and heel, and P.O.D.System branding on the lateral side.",285,adidas pod s31 core black,Jun,Saturday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,core black core black white,Black,91

AQ0996-102,Acronym x Nike VaporMax Moc 2 Sail,Nike,5/15/18,225,Sail/Dark Stucco-Cargo Khaki,"Errolson Hugh, co-founder of ACRONYM, has worked on three previous Nike models: the Lunar Force 1 (2015), much-lauded Presto (2016) and AF1 Downtown (2017). Each of these introduced a plausible solution to solve a discrete functional problem (for example, the Lunar Force 1 incorporated an easy-entry zip component).

He took a slightly different approach for his fourth shoe with the brand, a Nike Air VaporMax Moc 2. “There is absolutely nothing retro about it. It’s so forward,” he says of the shoe. “The physical aspect of it, once the laces are removed and with the elastic tongue…there is not really much that we felt we wanted to do functionally because it’s great.”

Instead, he and his team pivoted from their typical design process and considered the shoe “as a visual project.” They contemplated graphic applications conveying aggression and speed. And within these experiments, considered just how far they could possibly push while still keeping the shoe wearable.

Eventually, Hugh landed on a unique take on camouflage he built off his brand’s wordmark. “The patterning is basically the A from Acronym. It’s the original shape, and then it just gets turned into a grid. Each of the intersecting lines of the A inside the square makes the surface, and we just delete and inverse the various surfaces that result from those intersections. It makes for a kind of progression that you get these surprising shapes out of,” he says.

Through trial and error, it emerged that printing it onto the finished knit upper was the best application. This is because the graphic further deforms as the Flyknit is stretched over the last and attached to the VaporMax outsole. The resulting look is thus simultaneously arresting and covert — apropos of Hugh’s legacy of bold silhouettes replete with hidden detailing.",1169,acronym x nike vapormax moc 2 sail,May,Tuesday,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,sail dark stucco cargo khaki,Gray,193

AQ0996-007,Acronym x Nike VaporMax Moc 2 Black,Nike,4/26/18,225,Black/Volt-Black,"Errolson Hugh, co-founder of ACRONYM, has worked on three previous Nike models: the Lunar Force 1 (2015), much-lauded Presto (2016) and AF1 Downtown (2017). Each of these introduced a plausible solution to solve a discrete functional problem (for example, the Lunar Force 1 incorporated an easy-entry zip component).

He took a slightly different approach for his fourth shoe with the brand, a Nike Air VaporMax Moc 2. “There is absolutely nothing retro about it. It’s so forward,” he says of the shoe. “The physical aspect of it, once the laces are removed and with the elastic tongue…there is not really much that we felt we wanted to do functionally because it’s great.”

Instead, he and his team pivoted from their typical design process and considered the shoe “as a visual project.” They contemplated graphic applications conveying aggression and speed. And within these experiments, considered just how far they could possibly push while still keeping the shoe wearable.

Eventually, Hugh landed on a unique take on camouflage he built off his brand’s wordmark. “The patterning is basically the A from Acronym. It’s the original shape, and then it just gets turned into a grid. Each of the intersecting lines of the A inside the square makes the surface, and we just delete and inverse the various surfaces that result from those intersections. It makes for a kind of progression that you get these surprising shapes out of,” he says.

Through trial and error, it emerged that printing it onto the finished knit upper was the best application. This is because the graphic further deforms as the Flyknit is stretched over the last and attached to the VaporMax outsole. The resulting look is thus simultaneously arresting and covert — apropos of Hugh’s legacy of bold silhouettes replete with hidden detailing.",1266,acronym x nike vapormax moc 2 black,Apr,Thursday,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,black volt black,Black,205

AQ0996-001,Acronym x Nike VaporMax Moc 2 Light Bone,Nike,3/26/18,225,Light Bone/Volt-Light Bone-Black,"Errolson Hugh, co-founder of ACRONYM, has worked on three previous Nike models: the Lunar Force 1 (2015), much-lauded Presto (2016) and AF1 Downtown (2017). Each of these introduced a plausible solution to solve a discrete functional problem (for example, the Lunar Force 1 incorporated an easy-entry zip component).

He took a slightly different approach for his fourth shoe with the brand, a Nike Air VaporMax Moc 2. “There is absolutely nothing retro about it. It’s so forward,” he says of the shoe. “The physical aspect of it, once the laces are removed and with the elastic tongue…there is not really much that we felt we wanted to do functionally because it’s great.”

Instead, he and his team pivoted from their typical design process and considered the shoe “as a visual project.” They contemplated graphic applications conveying aggression and speed. And within these experiments, considered just how far they could possibly push while still keeping the shoe wearable.

Eventually, Hugh landed on a unique take on camouflage he built off his brand’s wordmark. “The patterning is basically the A from Acronym. It’s the original shape, and then it just gets turned into a grid. Each of the intersecting lines of the A inside the square makes the surface, and we just delete and inverse the various surfaces that result from those intersections. It makes for a kind of progression that you get these surprising shapes out of,” he says.

Through trial and error, it emerged that printing it onto the finished knit upper was the best application. This is because the graphic further deforms as the Flyknit is stretched over the last and attached to the VaporMax outsole. The resulting look is thus simultaneously arresting and covert — apropos of Hugh’s legacy of bold silhouettes replete with hidden detailing.",706,acronym x nike vapormax moc 2 light bone,Mar,Monday,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,light bone volt light bone black,Red,230

CM7878,Hanon x adidas New York Dark Storm,Adidas,12/9/17,150,Blue/Black-Grey,"Aberdeen-based retailer Hanon has come together with adidas for a new adidas Consortium release utilizing the adidas New York.

Taking a cue from the blustery climate of Aberdeen’s locale, this collaboration references the ever-changing Scottish skies. Known for their assortment of hard-to-find footwear and high-quality apparel, Hanon has long stocked technical outerwear suitable for the Scottish climate. For their latest interpretation with adidas, the retailer revisits their home and locale in the north east of Scotland, taking inspiration from the ‘3-seasons-in-a-day weather’ known for its intemperate climate expressed through the aesthetic of the reinterpreted classic runner.

The weather inspired rework, takes a cue from the 80’s New York signature design distinctive for its classic ZX styling and mesh grill that wraps the midsole. Hanon’s “Dark Storm” color-scheme alludes to the broken skies as dramatic rain clouds quickly sweeping in from across the Atlantic Ocean. These transitioning conditions are stylishly recreated in a bespoke jacquard woven pattern with a light-to-dark fade effect which is also applied to the midsole’s signature Dellinger webbing. Suede overlays give a premium look and feel to the exterior while the soft leather interior and a central section of the sole provide optimistic flashes of Originals blue – a homage to the early New York and a reminder that clear skies could be just moments away.

The sneaker comes with three sets of a laces – a thoughtful inclusion allowing the wearer to color-match with the weather conditions. Collaborative branding is visibly presented throughout the shoe, detailed on the side stripes, embossed on the leather tongue loops and screened to each back tab. The climate inspired silhouette even includes embossed coordinates of the city printed on the tongue reverse.",592,hanon x adidas new york dark storm,Dec,Saturday,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,blue black grey,Blue,66

927508-002,Nike Air Max 97 LX Swarovski Silver Bullet,Nike,9/21/17,400,Metallic Silver/Black-Red,"Known as the Nike Air Max 97 LX Swarovski, this luxurious version of the classic Nike runner comes in the OG Silver Bullet colorway but has been covered in Swarovski crystals for a new look. To celebrate its 20th anniversary and explore its future potential for Spring and Fall 2017, NikeWomen designers looked to a material pioneer, Swarovski, and their Crystal Fabric, to creatively embellish and add durability to the Air Max 97. Containing tiny, densely clustered cut and uncut crystals, the fabric offers a gleaming yet gritty appearance, perfect for a new expression of the original’s signature shine.

During a trip to the Swarovski headquarters in Wattens, Austria, NikeWomen Color and Material teams received rare access to company archives and learned about the 12 years of research that went into the production and innovative applications (which include jewelry, apparel, fabric, home décor, car interiors and watches) of Swarovski’s pioneering, sustainable Advanced Crystal formula. In particular, the NikeWomen team gravitated toward the Crystal Fabric.

 “This was such an exciting project in terms of material innovation,” says Marie Crow, Nike Material Design Director for NikeWomen Sportswear. “We were looking to explore shine and durability in a new and innovative way, and we loved the juxtaposition of the Crystal Fabric’s tough sparkle to reinvent an already iconic shoe.”

The fabric was then applied through a heat fusing process, without any stitching, that uses precise pattern pieces — varying for each shoe size — to curve around the waves of the 97, including the expanse of the one-piece rand. As the shoe moves, the crystals refract light with a bright, shimmering effect. Released in black for Spring, and now in silver for Fall, the Air Max 97 LX with Swarovski crystals marks the first time NikeWomen has used Swarovski crystals on a shoe, as well as the first time Nike has fused precious material onto the Air Max 97.

“Swarovski has a proud heritage of innovation and creative collaboration,” says Markus Langes-Swarovski, Swarovski Executive Board member. “We were delighted to partner with Nike to create this unique design. The Air Max 97 is a truly iconic 360-degree silhouette that has inspired us to imagine what might happen when speed meets light.”",1935,nike air max 97 lx swarovski silver bullet,Sep,Thursday,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,metallic silver black red,Black,789

The new Nike Kobe A.D. Mid applies Bryant’s intrigue of how color personally affects him by releasing the model in five different tonal offerings that illuminate the origins and depth of his need and desire for improvement.

The Nike Kobe A.D. comes in five different colorways that are linked to five different representations. They’re as follows.

Purple represents overcoming challenges and setting fresh goals.
Red is acknowledged as a symbol of passion.
Yellow represents positivity.
Grey represents calm neutrality.
Blue transmits dependability and trust.

For those of you who may not know, Momofuku is a culinary brand established by chef David Chang in 2004 with the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar. The Momofuku aprons are usually made out of dark denim fabric, which is very similar to the material used on the uppers of the SB Dunks you see above. This collab came about as a result of the long-standing relationship between members of the skate community, the Nike SB team and the Momofuku restaurants. Chang fell in love with Nike in 1987. According to the chef, the moment he saw the first visible Air: “Was one of the coolest things I’d ever seen.” Ever since then, he’s been loyal to the Swoosh and was more than ecstatic to collaborate with Nike SB on this project.

Notable features on the shoe include the numbers “163” and “207” on the sock liners which represent the addresses of David’s Fuku and Ssäm Bar restaurants in NYC, respectively. The Momofuku logo (peach) appears on the shoe’s heel to help give the shoe even more of a intimate collaborative feel.

V55619,Reebok Answer IV Stepover,Reebok,6/9/17,150,Black/White,"The Reebok Answer IV Stepover pays homage to one of the most memorable moments in Iverson’s NBA career. You know what I’m talking about: June 6th, 2001. Game 1 of the NBA Finals. A.I. stepped over Ty Lue right after draining a 20 foot jumper that basically sealed the deal and gave Philly a W over the mighty Lakers.

Rocking an OG look and feel, the shoe comes in a Black and White premium leather upper placed on top of a Black sole unit equipped with the patented DMX cushioning system.

Notable features on the upper include the zippered shroud on top of the lacing system and the I3 branding on the side of the toe.

Notable benefits include greater elasticity, compliancy and support.

“I wanted to combine Nike’s rich experimentation in boot silhouettes with my love of the Chelsea Boot, in particular,” “Shoes like the Nike Aqua Boot or SFB Boot have been equally embraced by niche sport communities and adopted as style staples. After our first collaboration in 2014, when I designed an Air Force 1 Boot for Nike, I knew I had even more visions of this kind of sport style to realize.”

818018100,Nike WMNS Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit - White,Nike,1/28/16,175,White / Pure Platinum - White,"It’s crazy to think that the original Nike Air Force 1 made its debut back in 1982. In other words, 34 years ago, that’s older than me, and I’m old! Over the years we’ve seen countless iterations (2,000), with each version giving the classics a new look and feel to keep the momentum going. The basketball shoe that turned into a street wear icon has had one hell of a run, and just when you think it could offer no more, Nike went ahead and revolutionized the shoe once more by utilizing their beloved Flyknit technology on to the Nike Air Force 1. Although we’ve already seen the Nike Flyknit Air Force 1, the shoe had not been officially unveiled by Nike, until today. Let’s take a look at the shoe officially dubbed the Nike Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit.

The application process had Nike designers taking 12-hour inspiration walks around Paris during the summer. Soon enough that led to the conviction that they could make the shoe lighter and flexible while simultaneously enhancing the fit and reducing the creasing on the toebox. They found a way to give the shoe a modern look while preserving the classic aesthetics of the AF1. Nike Footwear Design Director Jonathan Johnsongriffin bonded a dark grey Flyknit upper to a 3D-printed prototype of an Air Force 1 sole, then went on to use a black marker to color in the Swoosh and eye soles. Surprisingly, it worked! It still had the classic look, but it was now more comfortable and lighter than ever!

The team of designers wanted to keep the concentric circles of the archetype sole’s shoe pivots as well as the AIR lettering and tooling. So what they decided to do was deboss instead of emboss the lettering and also use injected unit rubber tooling instead of polyurethane tooling to make the shoe even lighter. With it comes to the Flyknit upper, the teams collaborated to create the exact structures and textures necessary to maintain the shape and paneling of the original Air Force 1. Flyknit technology enabled them to precisely micro-engineer every stitch to create the featherweight upper for maximum comfort and minimal weight. Not only did the shoe become the lightest Air Force 1 ever made (half the weight of the original), it was also the first Flyknit shoe to include a leather Swoosh logo.

817420600,Nike Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit - University Red,Nike,1/28/16,175,University Red / Team Red - White - Black,"It’s crazy to think that the original Nike Air Force 1 made its debut back in 1982. In other words, 34 years ago, that’s older than me, and I’m old! Over the years we’ve seen countless iterations (2,000), with each version giving the classics a new look and feel to keep the momentum going. The basketball shoe that turned into a street wear icon has had one hell of a run, and just when you think it could offer no more, Nike went ahead and revolutionized the shoe once more by utilizing their beloved Flyknit technology on to the Nike Air Force 1. Although we’ve already seen the Nike Flyknit Air Force 1, the shoe had not been officially unveiled by Nike, until today. Let’s take a look at the shoe officially dubbed the Nike Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit.

The application process had Nike designers taking 12-hour inspiration walks around Paris during the summer. Soon enough that led to the conviction that they could make the shoe lighter and flexible while simultaneously enhancing the fit and reducing the creasing on the toebox. They found a way to give the shoe a modern look while preserving the classic aesthetics of the AF1. Nike Footwear Design Director Jonathan Johnsongriffin bonded a dark grey Flyknit upper to a 3D-printed prototype of an Air Force 1 sole, then went on to use a black marker to color in the Swoosh and eye soles. Surprisingly, it worked! It still had the classic look, but it was now more comfortable and lighter than ever!

The team of designers wanted to keep the concentric circles of the archetype sole’s shoe pivots as well as the AIR lettering and tooling. So what they decided to do was deboss instead of emboss the lettering and also use injected unit rubber tooling instead of polyurethane tooling to make the shoe even lighter. With it comes to the Flyknit upper, the teams collaborated to create the exact structures and textures necessary to maintain the shape and paneling of the original Air Force 1. Flyknit technology enabled them to precisely micro-engineer every stitch to create the featherweight upper for maximum comfort and minimal weight. Not only did the shoe become the lightest Air Force 1 ever made (half the weight of the original), it was also the first Flyknit shoe to include a leather Swoosh logo.

The Nike Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit will debut in multicolor, University Red for NSW, in addition to an all-white iteration in NikeLab.

The KD VI Precision Timing colorway brings clockwork details to life. The upper features radial machining lines, which mimic fine wristwatch detailing, that are reflective. The Swoosh and KD logo are show micro machining marks. Metallic silver and gold throughout the shoe further the clockwork storytelling, with mint accents setting off the shoe.
